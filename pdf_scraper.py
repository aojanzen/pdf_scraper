Scrape all pdf documents in the current folder and all sub-folders, extract the
text from these files, remove all punctuation and numbers, and then count the
remaining words in the text to identify the most frequently used characteristic
words in the document. These words will be stored (e.g. in an SQLite database)
so that -- finally -- pdf files with similar content can be identified
automatically.

The motivation for this app is the vast number of scientific publications that
I have gathered for work and which have now become too many to sort them by
hand.
